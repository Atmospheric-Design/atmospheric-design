Artificial Mirror: exhibition stand at World Summit AI, 2018, Amsterdam

Artificial Mirror trains a neural network to respond emotionally with visual stimulants by smiling or frowning 
at the image so that it may learn from your human reaction. A social experiment that shows us what our society
perceives to be good and bad, positive or negative. It also asks whether we can train neural networks to make 
ethical decisions on our behalf.
