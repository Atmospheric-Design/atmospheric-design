          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had the privilege to showcase the many uses and
            applications of the unique Atmospheric Wood treatment at various
            design markets and conventions, including Dutch Design Week 2017 in
            Eindhoven, The Maker Market in Amsterdam, and the Makerversity
            creative space in Amsterdam.

            Atmospheric Wood debuted in 2017 and immediately received the
            opportunity to showcase the treatment’s applications at Dutch Design
            Week.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The presentation in Eindhoven was exhibited as part of an artist
            collective called “Conscious creativity” and was received with an
            overwhelmingly positive response. The collective consisted of
            designers, like-minded entrepreneurs, inventors, technologists,
            makers and creators. Our aim was to inspire and expand the horizon
            of creative industries and forecast the built environment of the
            coming 100 years. The convention and its surrounding events was the
            beginning of multiple artist collaborations since.
