            <h1>Restored white and black bench</h1>
            <p>A stylish study in geometric weaving, this symmetrical macramé bench is a perfect fit for any minimally stylized home. The bench consists of nearly 100 meters of  white macramé thread, tightly woven around a fully restored and painted solid steel frame. Both the fabric top and the steel legs have been treated to withstand time.</p>
